## --- Day 23: Crab Cups ---
The small crab challenges <em>you</em> to a game! The crab is going to mix up some cups, and you have to predict where they'll end up.

The cups will be arranged in a circle and labeled <em>clockwise</em> (your puzzle input). For example, if your labeling were <code>32415</code>, there would be five cups in the circle; going clockwise around the circle from the first cup, the cups would be labeled <code>3</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>4</code>, <code>1</code>, <code>5</code>, and then back to <code>3</code> again.
