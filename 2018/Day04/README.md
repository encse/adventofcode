## --- Day 4: Repose Record ---
You've sneaked into another supply closet - this time, it's across from the prototype suit manufacturing lab. You need to sneak inside and fix the issues with the suit, but there's a guard stationed outside the lab, so this is as close as you can safely get.

As you search the closet for anything that might help, you discover that you're not the first person to want to sneak in.  Covering the walls, someone has spent an hour starting every midnight for the past few months secretly observing this guard post!  They've been writing down the ID of *the one guard on duty that night* - the Elves seem to have decided that one guard was enough for the overnight shift - as well as when they fall asleep or wake up while at their post (your puzzle input).
