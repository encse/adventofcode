## --- Day 14: Extended Polymerization ---
The incredible pressures at this depth are starting to put a strain on your submarine. The submarine has [polymerization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerization) equipment that would produce suitable materials to reinforce the submarine, and the nearby volcanically-active caves should even have the necessary input elements in sufficient quantities.

The submarine manual contains instructions for finding the optimal polymer formula; specifically, it offers a <em>polymer template</em> and a list of <em>pair insertion</em> rules (your puzzle input). You just need to work out what polymer would result after repeating the pair insertion process a few times.
