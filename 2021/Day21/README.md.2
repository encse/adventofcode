## --- Day 21: Dirac Dice ---
There's not much to do as you slowly descend to the bottom of the ocean. The submarine computer challenges you to a nice game of <em>Dirac Dice</em>.

This game consists of a single [die](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice), two [pawns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_board_games#piece), and a game board with a circular track containing ten spaces marked <code>1</code> through <code>10</code> clockwise. Each player's <em>starting space</em> is chosen randomly (your puzzle input). Player 1 goes first.
