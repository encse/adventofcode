## --- Day 12: Garden Groups ---
Why not search for the Chief Historian near the _gardener_ and his _massive farm_? There's plenty of food, so The Historians grab something to eat while they search.

You're about to settle near a complex arrangement of garden plots when some Elves ask if you can lend a hand. They'd like to set up fences around each region of garden plots, but they can't figure out how much fence they need to order or how much it will cost. They hand you a map (your puzzle input) of the garden plots.

One can sense that the difficulty has ramped up today with a more complex problem involving area and perimeter calculations. 

First we determine the connected components (regions) of plants of the same type. This is done by picking a position of the 
garden and applying a standard flood-fill algorithm to it. The result is a _region_. As we process each region, we carefully 
remove all affected positions and then pick an untouched position to repeat the process. In a few iterations, the entire 
garden is associated with the correct regions. The size of the regions corresponds to the _area_  in question. This logic 
is implemented in the `GetRegions` function below.

The second part of the problem, however, is more intriguing: how do we calculate the lengths of the fences? In part 1, this is 
relatively simple because we just iterate through each region and count the neighboring cells that belong to a different regions. 
This tells how many fence is needed. Unfortunately, this logic doesn't work for part 2...

I attempted to implement a "walk-around" approach, which involves finding a fence segment and tracing it like a line-following 
robot while counting the turns. The challenge with this approach is that some regions have holes, that require fences as well 
and I didnt want to implement hole finding.

Later realized that it is probably more straightforward to collect the fence segments along straight lines scanning the garden 
from top to bottom an right to left. This is how I solved the problem.

Finally went to reddit and read the hint: the number of segments equal to the number of corners... In other words difference
between part 1 and 2 is very small. In part 1 we are building an edge detector which becomes a corner detector in part 2. I changed
my implementation to that. 

This concludes our day 12. I'll take an extra ‚≠ê for learning something new again.
