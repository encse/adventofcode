## --- Day 1: Historian Hysteria ---
The <em>Chief Historian</em> is always present for the big Christmas sleigh launch, but nobody has seen him in months! Last anyone heard, he was visiting locations that are historically significant to the North Pole; a group of Senior Historians has asked you to accompany them as they check the places they think he was most likely to visit.

As each location is checked, they will mark it on their list with a <em>star</em>. They figure the Chief Historian <em>must</em> be in one of the first fifty places they'll look, so in order to save Christmas, you need to help them get <em>fifty stars</em> on their list before Santa takes off on December 25th.
