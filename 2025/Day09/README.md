## --- Day 9: Movie Theater ---
You slide down the [firepole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireman%27s_pole) in the corner of the playground and land in the North Pole base movie theater!

The movie theater has a big tile floor with an interesting pattern. Elves here are redecorating the theater by switching out some of the square tiles in the big grid they form. Some of the tiles are <em>red</em>; the Elves would like to find the largest rectangle that uses red tiles for two of its opposite corners. They even have a list of where the red tiles are located in the grid (your puzzle input).
