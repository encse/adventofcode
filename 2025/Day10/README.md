## --- Day 10: Factory ---
Just across the hall, you find a large factory. Fortunately, the Elves here have plenty of time to decorate. Unfortunately, it's because the factory machines are all offline, and none of the Elves can figure out the initialization procedure.

The Elves do have the manual for the machines, but the section detailing the initialization procedure was eaten by a [Shiba Inu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiba_Inu). All that remains of the manual are some indicator light diagrams, button wiring schematics, and [joltage](3) requirements for each machine.
