## --- Day 3: Spiral Memory ---
You come across an experimental new kind of memory stored on an infinite two-dimensional grid.

Each square on the grid is allocated in a spiral pattern starting at a location marked `1` and then counting up while spiraling outward. For example, the first few squares are allocated like this:

```
17  16  15  14  13
18   5   4   3  12
19   6   1   2  11
20   7   8   9  10
21  22  23---> ...
```

While this is very space-efficient (no squares are skipped), requested data must be carried back to square `1` (the location of the only access port for this memory system) by programs that can only move up, down, left, or right. They always take the shortest path: the [Manhattan Distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry) between the location of the data and square `1`.

For example:


 - Data from square `1` is carried `0` steps, since it's at the access port.
 - Data from square `12` is carried `3` steps, such as: down, left, left.
 - Data from square `23` is carried only `2` steps: up twice.
 - Data from square `1024` must be carried `31` steps.

*How many steps* are required to carry the data from the square identified in your puzzle input all the way to the access port?


## --- Part Two ---
As a stress test on the system, the programs here clear the grid and then store the value `1` in square `1`. Then, in the same allocation order as shown above, they store the sum of the values in all adjacent squares, including diagonals.

So, the first few squares' values are chosen as follows:


 - Square `1` starts with the value `1`.
 - Square `2` has only one adjacent filled square (with value `1`), so it also stores `1`.
 - Square `3` has both of the above squares as neighbors and stores the sum of their values, `2`.
 - Square `4` has all three of the aforementioned squares as neighbors and stores the sum of their values, `4`.
 - Square `5` only has the first and fourth squares as neighbors, so it gets the value `5`.

Once a square is written, its value does not change. Therefore, the first few squares would receive the following values:

```
147  142  133  122   59
304    5    4    2   57
330   10    1    1   54
351   11   23   25   26
362  747  806--->   ...
```

What is the *first value written* that is *larger* than your puzzle input?
