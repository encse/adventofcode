 today                 Shortcut to the above
 [year]                Solve the whole year
 all                   Solve everything

2) To start working on new problems:
login to https://adventofcode.com, then copy your session cookie, and export 
it in your console like this

 export SESSION=73a37e9a72a...

then run the app with

 update [year]/[day]   Prepares a folder for the given day, updates the input,
                       the readme and creates a solution template.
 update today          Shortcut to the above.

3) To upload your answer:
set up your SESSION variable as above.

 upload [year]/[day]   Upload the answer for the selected year and day.
 upload today          Shortcut to the above.

## Working in Visual Studio Code
If you prefer, you can work directly in VSCode as well. 
 
 Open the command Palette (⇧ ⌘ P), select `Tasks: Run Task` then e.g. `update today`.

 Work on part 1. Check the solution with the `upload today` task. Continue with part 2.

 **Note:** this feature relies on the "Memento Inputs" extension to store your session cookie, you need 
 to set it up in advance from the Command Palette with `Install Extensions`.
