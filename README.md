   C# solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) problems.

   I'm making a [website](https://aoc.csokavar.hu) out of this. A lot of effort goes into my solutions spending
   time on presenting things in an easy to understand and elegant way. In other words, the solutions are
   not the most effective or shortest, but hopefully more readable.
   
   Like what you see? Consider [sponsoring](https://github.com/sponsors/encse) me.
   
   The framework I'm using is freely available and it's pretty streamlined by now. You can start with the 
   https://github.com/encse/adventofcode-template repository.

   ## Dependencies
   - Based on `.NET 9` and `C# 13`. 
   - `AngleSharp` is used for problem download.
   - git-crypt to store the input files in an encrypted form
