   I'm making a [website](https://aoc.csokavar.hu) out of this. A lot of effort goes into my solutions, 
   I aim for clarity. In other words, they are not super effective or super short, but hopefully more readable.
   
   Like what you see? Consider [sponsoring](https://github.com/sponsors/encse) me.
   
   The framework I'm using is freely available and it's pretty streamlined by now. You can start with the 
   https://github.com/encse/adventofcode-template repository.

   ## Dependencies
   - Based on `.NET 9` and `C# 13`. 
   - `AngleSharp` is used for problem download.
   - git-crypt to store the input files in an encrypted form
