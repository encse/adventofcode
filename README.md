   # Advent of Code (2015-2024)
   C# solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) problems.

   I'm making a [website](https://aoc.csokavar.hu) out of this. 
   
   A lot of effort goes into my solutions to present things in an easy to understand and elegant way. Clarity first also means less emphasis on speed, but I try to balance it until each puzzle's runtime fits into a second.
   
   The framework I'm using is freely available and it's pretty streamlined by now. You can start with the 
   https://github.com/encse/adventofcode-template repository.
