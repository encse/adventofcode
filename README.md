   C# solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) problems.

   You can freely use my framework, it's probably easiest to start out from the 
   https://github.com/encse/adventofcode-template repository.

   I put a lot of effort into my solutions. They are not super effective or super short, but hopefully more readable. I aim for clarity.

   I'm happy if you consider [supporting](https://github.com/sponsors/encse) my work.

   ## Dependencies
   - Based on `.NET 9` and `C# 13`. 
   - `AngleSharp` is used for problem download.
   - git-crypt to store the input files in an encrypted form
