   C# solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) problems.

   I'm making a [website](https://aoc.csokavar.hu) out of this. I put a lot of effort into my solutions. 
   They are not super effective or super short, but hopefully more readable. I aim for clarity.
   
   You can use my framework, it's probably easiest to start with the 
   https://github.com/encse/adventofcode-template repository.

   Like what you see? Consider [sponsoring](https://github.com/sponsors/encse) me.

   ## Dependencies
   - Based on `.NET 9` and `C# 13`. 
   - `AngleSharp` is used for problem download.
   - git-crypt to store the input files in an encrypted form
