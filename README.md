   C# solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) problems.

   If you want to use my framework, it's probably easiest to start out from the 
   https://github.com/encse/adventofcode-template repository.

   I put a lot of effort into my solutions. I aim for clarity, which means that 
   they are not super effective or super short, but hopefully more readable.

   If you find project useful, please [support](https://github.com/sponsors/encse) me.

   ## Dependencies
   - Based on `.NET 8`  and `C# 12`. 
   - `AngleSharp` is used for problem download.
