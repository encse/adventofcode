## --- Day 17: Clumsy Crucible ---
The lava starts flowing rapidly once the Lava Production Facility is operational. As you leave, the reindeer offers you a parachute, allowing you to quickly reach Gear Island.

As you descend, your bird's-eye view of Gear Island reveals why you had trouble finding anyone on your way up: half of Gear Island is empty, but the half below you is a giant factory city!

You land near the gradually-filling pool of lava at the base of your new <em>lavafall</em>. Lavaducts will eventually carry the lava throughout the city, but to make use of it immediately, Elves are loading it into large [crucibles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucible) on wheels.
