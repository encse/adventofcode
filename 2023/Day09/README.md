## --- Day 9: Mirage Maintenance ---
Let's revisit the problem description [here](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/9).

We are implementing an _extrapolation_ algorithm that reminds me to my 
university years when we did Newton interpolation, or was it Lagrange? I don't 
remember anymore, but it was using a similar algorithm to this.

Part 1 and Part 2 differs only in the direction of the extrapolation, and one 
can be implemented using the other, just like I did it below.
