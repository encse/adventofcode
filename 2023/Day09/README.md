## --- Day 9: Mirage Maintenance ---
You ride the camel through the sandstorm and stop where the ghost's maps told you to stop. The sandstorm subsequently subsides, somehow seeing you standing at an <em>oasis</em>!

The camel goes to get some water and you stretch your neck. As you look up, you discover what must be yet another giant floating island, this one made of metal! That must be where the <em>parts to fix the sand machines</em> come from.

There's even a [hang glider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hang_gliding) partially buried in the sand here; once the sun rises and heats up the sand, you might be able to use the glider and the hot air to get all the way up to the metal island!
