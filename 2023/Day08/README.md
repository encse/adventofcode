## --- Day 8: Haunted Wasteland ---
You're still riding a camel across Desert Island when you spot a sandstorm quickly approaching. When you turn to warn the Elf, she disappears before your eyes! To be fair, she had just finished warning you about <em>ghosts</em> a few minutes ago.

One of the camel's pouches is labeled "maps" - sure enough, it's full of documents (your puzzle input) about how to navigate the desert. At least, you're pretty sure that's what they are; one of the documents contains a list of left/right instructions, and the rest of the documents seem to describe some kind of <em>network</em> of labeled nodes.

It seems like you're meant to use the <em>left/right</em> instructions to <em>navigate the network</em>. Perhaps if you have the camel follow the same instructions, you can escape the haunted wasteland!
