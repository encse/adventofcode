You continue following signs for "Hot Springs" and eventually come across an [observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observatory). The Elf within turns out to be a researcher studying cosmic expansion using the giant telescope here.

He doesn't know anything about the missing machine parts; he's only visiting for this research project. However, he confirms that the hot springs are the next-closest area likely to have people; he'll even take you straight there once he's done with today's observation analysis.

Maybe you can help him with the analysis to speed things up?
