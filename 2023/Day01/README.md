## --- Day 1: Trebuchet?! ---
Those who need a refresh can read the problem [here](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/1), 
then let's get started. Our Elves need us! 

Part 1 was super easy, ok, this is day one just to warm up a bit. It's some regular 
expression, let's see Part 2! 

Wait a minute, huhh... what is this? _Oneight?_ What does this even mean? Usually such weird 
cases are mentioned in the example input, but not this time! Is it '1', '8' or '18'? Depending on 
how one interpreted the problem statement he could spent quite a lot of time on figuring this out. 

I think this was a little bit of an oversight for day 1, but let's see what's up for tomorrow!
