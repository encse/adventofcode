## --- Day 1: Trebuchet?! ---
Something is wrong with global snow production, and you've been selected to take a look. The Elves have even given you a map; on it, they've used stars to mark the top fifty locations that are likely to be having problems.

You've been doing this long enough to know that to restore snow operations, you need to check all <em>fifty stars</em> by December 25th.

Collect stars by solving puzzles.  Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first.  Each puzzle grants <em>one star</em>. Good luck!

## --- Notes ---
The wait is over, let's get started, our elves need us! 

Part 1 is super easy, ok, this is day one just to warm up a bit. It's some regular expression, let's see Part 2! 

Wait a minute, huhh... what is this? _Oneight?_ What does this even mean? Usually such weird cases 
are mentioned in the example input, but not this time! Is it '1', '8' or '18'? Depending on how one interpreted 
the problem statement he could spent quite a lot of time on figuring this out. 

I think this was a little bit of an oversight for day 1, but let's see what's up for tomorrow!
