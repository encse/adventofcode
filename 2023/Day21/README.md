## --- Day 21: Step Counter ---
You manage to catch the [airship](7) right as it's dropping someone else off on their all-expenses-paid trip to Desert Island! It even helpfully drops you off near the [gardener](5) and his massive farm.

While you wait, one of the Elves that works with the gardener heard how good you are at solving problems and would like your help. He needs to get his [steps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedometer) in for the day, and so he'd like to know <em>which garden plots he can reach with exactly his remaining <code>64</code> steps</em>.
