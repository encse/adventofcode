## --- Day 11: Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators ---
You come upon a column of four floors that have been entirely sealed off from the rest of the building except for a small dedicated lobby.  There are some radiation warnings and a big sign which reads "Radioisotope Testing Facility".

According to the project status board, this facility is currently being used to experiment with [Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioisotope_thermoelectric_generator) (RTGs, or simply "generators") that are designed to be paired with specially-constructed microchips. Basically, an RTG is a highly radioactive rock that generates electricity through heat.
