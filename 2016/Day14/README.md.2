## --- Day 14: One-Time Pad ---
In order to communicate securely with Santa while you're on this mission, you've been using a [one-time pad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad) that you [generate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_through_obscurity) using a pre-agreed algorithm. Unfortunately, you've run out of keys in your one-time pad, and so you need to generate some more.

To generate keys, you first get a stream of random data by taking the [MD5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5) of a pre-arranged [salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)) (your puzzle input) and an increasing integer index (starting with `0`, and represented in decimal); the resulting MD5 hash should be represented as a string of *lowercase* hexadecimal digits.
