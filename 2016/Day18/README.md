## --- Day 18: Like a Rogue ---
As you enter this room, you hear a loud click! Some of the tiles in the floor here seem to be pressure plates for [traps](https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Trap), and the trap you just triggered has run out of... whatever it tried to do to you. You doubt you'll be so lucky next time.

Upon closer examination, the traps and safe tiles in this room seem to follow a pattern. The tiles are arranged into rows that are all the same width; you take note of the safe tiles (`.`) and traps (`^`) in the first row (your puzzle input).
