## --- Day 20: Firewall Rules ---
You'd like to set up a small hidden computer here so you can use it to get back into the network later. However, the corporate firewall only allows communication with certain external [IP addresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4#Addressing).

Also, rather than being written in [dot-decimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-decimal_notation) notation, they are written as plain [32-bit integers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/32-bit), which can have any value from `0` through `4294967295`, inclusive.
