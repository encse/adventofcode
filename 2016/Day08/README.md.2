## --- Day 8: Two-Factor Authentication ---
You come across a door implementing what you can only assume is an implementation of [two-factor authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication) after a long game of [requirements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirement) [telephone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_whispers).

To get past the door, you first swipe a keycard (no problem; there was one on a nearby desk). Then, it displays a code on a [little screen](https://www.google.com/search?q=tiny+lcd&tbm=isch), and you type that code on a keypad. Then, presumably, the door unlocks.
