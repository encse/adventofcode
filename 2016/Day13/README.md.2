## --- Day 13: A Maze of Twisty Little Cubicles ---
You arrive at the first floor of this new building to discover a much less welcoming environment than the shiny atrium of the last one.  Instead, you are in a maze of twisty little cubicles, all alike.

Every location in this area is addressed by a pair of non-negative integers (`x,y`). Each such coordinate is either a wall or an open space. You can't move diagonally. The cube maze starts at `0,0` and seems to extend infinitely toward *positive* `x` and `y`; negative values are *invalid*, as they represent a location outside the building. You are in a small waiting area at `1,1`.
