## --- Day 22: Slam Shuffle ---
There isn't much to do while you wait for the droids to repair your ship.  At least you're drifting in the right direction.  You decide to practice a new [card shuffle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuffling) you've been working on.

Digging through the ship's storage, you find a deck of *space cards*! Just like any deck of space cards, there are 10007 cards in the deck numbered `0` through `10006`. The deck must be new - they're still in *factory order*, with `0` on the top, then `1`, then `2`, and so on, all the way through to `10006` on the bottom.
