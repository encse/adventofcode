## --- Day 12: The N-Body Problem ---
The space near Jupiter is not a very safe place; you need to be careful of a [big distracting red spot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Red_Spot), extreme [radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetosphere_of_Jupiter), and a [whole lot of moons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moons_of_Jupiter#List) swirling around.  You decide to start by tracking the four largest moons: *Io*, *Europa*, *Ganymede*, and *Callisto*.

After a brief scan, you calculate the *position of each moon* (your puzzle input). You just need to *simulate their motion* so you can avoid them.
