## --- Day 7: Amplification Circuit ---
Based on the navigational maps, you're going to need to send more power to your ship's thrusters to reach Santa in time. To do this, you'll need to configure a series of [amplifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplifier) already installed on the ship.

There are five amplifiers connected in series; each one receives an input signal and produces an output signal.  They are connected such that the first amplifier's output leads to the second amplifier's input, the second amplifier's output leads to the third amplifier's input, and so on.  The first amplifier's input value is `0`, and the last amplifier's output leads to your ship's thrusters.
