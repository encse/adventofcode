## --- Day 14: Space Stoichiometry ---
As you approach the rings of Saturn, your ship's *low fuel* indicator turns on.  There isn't any fuel here, but the rings have plenty of raw material.  Perhaps your ship's Inter-Stellar Refinery Union brand *nanofactory* can turn these raw materials into fuel.

You ask the nanofactory to produce a list of the *reactions* it can perform that are relevant to this process (your puzzle input). Every reaction turns some quantities of specific *input chemicals* into some quantity of an *output chemical*. Almost every *chemical* is produced by exactly one reaction; the only exception, `ORE`, is the raw material input to the entire process and is not produced by a reaction.
