## --- Day 16: Flawed Frequency Transmission ---
You're 3/4ths of the way through the [gas giants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_giant). Not only do roundtrip signals to Earth take five hours, but the signal quality is quite bad as well.  You can clean up the signal with the Flawed Frequency Transmission algorithm, or *FFT*.

As input, FFT takes a list of numbers.  In the signal you received (your puzzle input), each number is a single digit: data like `15243` represents the sequence `1`, `5`, `2`, `4`, `3`.
