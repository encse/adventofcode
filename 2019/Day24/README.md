## --- Day 24: Planet of Discord ---
You land on [Eris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eris_(dwarf_planet)), your last stop before reaching Santa.  As soon as you do, your sensors start picking up strange life forms moving around: Eris is infested with [bugs](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/thisday/sep9/worlds-first-computer-bug/)! With an over 24-hour roundtrip for messages between you and Earth, you'll have to deal with this problem on your own.

Eris isn't a very large place; a scan of the entire area fits into a 5x5 grid (your puzzle input). The scan shows *bugs* (`#`) and *empty spaces* (`.`).
