## --- Day 2: 1202 Program Alarm ---
On the way to your [gravity assist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_assist) around the Moon, your ship computer beeps angrily about a "[1202 program alarm](https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.landing.html#1023832)". On the radio, an Elf is already explaining how to handle the situation: "Don't worry, that's perfectly norma--" The ship computer [bursts into flames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halt_and_Catch_Fire).

You notify the Elves that the computer's [magic smoke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_smoke) seems to have escaped. "That computer ran *Intcode* programs like the gravity assist program it was working on; surely there are enough spare parts up there to build a new Intcode computer!"
