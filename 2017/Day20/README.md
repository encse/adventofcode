## --- Day 20: Particle Swarm ---
Suddenly, the GPU contacts you, asking for help. Someone has asked it to simulate *too many particles*, and it won't be able to finish them all in time to render the next frame at this rate.

It transmits to you a buffer (your puzzle input) listing each particle in order (starting with particle `0`, then particle `1`, particle `2`, and so on). For each particle, it provides the `X`, `Y`, and `Z` coordinates for the particle's position (`p`), velocity (`v`), and acceleration (`a`), each in the format `<X,Y,Z>`.
