## --- Day 1: Inverse Captcha ---
The night before Christmas, one of Santa's Elves calls you in a panic. "The printer's broken! We can't print the <em>Naughty or Nice List</em>!" By the time you make it to sub-basement 17, there are only a few minutes until midnight. "We have a big problem," she says; "there must be almost <em>fifty</em> bugs in this system, but nothing else can print The List. Stand in this square, quick! There's no time to explain; if you can convince them to pay you in <em>stars</em>, you'll be able to--" She pulls a lever and the world goes blurry.
