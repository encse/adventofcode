## --- Day 13: Packet Scanners ---
You need to cross a vast *firewall*. The firewall consists of several layers, each with a *security scanner* that moves back and forth across the layer. To succeed, you must not be detected by a scanner.

By studying the firewall briefly, you are able to record (in your puzzle input) the *depth* of each layer and the *range* of the scanning area for the scanner within it, written as `depth: range`. Each layer has a thickness of exactly `1`. A layer at depth `0` begins immediately inside the firewall; a layer at depth `1` would start immediately after that.
