## --- Day 7: Some Assembly Required ---
This year, Santa brought little Bobby Tables a set of wires and [bitwise logic gates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation)!  Unfortunately, little Bobby is a little under the recommended age range, and he needs help assembling the circuit.

Each wire has an identifier (some lowercase letters) and can carry a [16-bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16-bit) signal (a number from `0` to `65535`).  A signal is provided to each wire by a gate, another wire, or some specific value. Each wire can only get a signal from one source, but can provide its signal to multiple destinations.  A gate provides no signal until all of its inputs have a signal.
