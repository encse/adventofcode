## --- Day 10: Elves Look, Elves Say ---
Today, the Elves are playing a game called [look-and-say](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Look-and-say_sequence).  They take turns making sequences by reading aloud the previous sequence and using that reading as the next sequence.  For example, `211` is read as "one two, two ones", which becomes `1221` (`1` `2`, `2` `1`s).

Look-and-say sequences are generated iteratively, using the previous value as input for the next step.  For each step, take the previous value, and replace each run of digits (like `111`) with the number of digits (`3`) followed by the digit itself (`1`).
