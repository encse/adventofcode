## --- Day 1: Not Quite Lisp ---
Santa was hoping for a white Christmas, but his weather machine's "snow" function is powered by stars, and he's fresh out!  To save Christmas, he needs you to collect <em>fifty stars</em> by December 25th.

Collect stars by helping Santa solve puzzles.  Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first.  Each puzzle grants <em>one star</em>. Good luck!
