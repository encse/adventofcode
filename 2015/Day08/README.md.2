## --- Day 8: Matchsticks ---
Space on the sleigh is limited this year, and so Santa will be bringing his list as a digital copy. He needs to know how much space it will take up when stored.

It is common in many programming languages to provide a way to escape special characters in strings.  For example, [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_sequences_in_C), [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String), [Perl](http://perldoc.perl.org/perlop.html#Quote-and-Quote-like-Operators), [Python](https://docs.python.org/2.0/ref/strings.html), and even [PHP](http://php.net/manual/en/language.types.string.php#language.types.string.syntax.double) handle special characters in very similar ways.
