## --- Day 4: The Ideal Stocking Stuffer ---
Santa needs help [mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#Mining) some AdventCoins (very similar to [bitcoins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin)) to use as gifts for all the economically forward-thinking little girls and boys.

To do this, he needs to find [MD5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5) hashes which, in [hexadecimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal), start with at least *five zeroes*.  The input to the MD5 hash is some secret key (your puzzle input, given below) followed by a number in decimal. To mine AdventCoins, you must find Santa the lowest positive number (no leading zeroes: `1`, `2`, `3`, ...) that produces such a hash.
